FingerNav: AI-Powered Virtual Mouse FingerNav is an innovative AI-based virtual mouse that enables users to navigate displays and monitors from a distance using only their fingers. Designed to enhance user experiences in VR environments and touchless interfaces, FingerNav employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to track hand movements and gestures, providing an intuitive way to interact with digital content. This project will be hosted on the on-demand platform. Future Enhancements include: Integrated Voice Control: Added commands for easier access. VR compatibility: Extend the system to work with multiple VR platforms and AR devices. Our virtual mouse sets itself apart by enabling seamless interaction in VR and AR environments, allowing users to navigate displays from a distance using only their fingers. Additionally, it offers customizable gesture controls and AI-driven learning for personalized, precise gesture recognition, ensuring a smooth and adaptive user experience. We can also use these to use as an app that can help a user to write their problems and solve them. You can view our presentation at https://github.com/rajmridul/AI-Virtual-Mouse
